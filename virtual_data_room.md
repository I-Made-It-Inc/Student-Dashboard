# Core Features

Create a new sub-page, which functions similar to virtual data rooms used in corporate mergers and acquisitions. This is a space where students can upload their professional materials to show recruiters when they apply for jobs (resume, reference letters, past projects, certificates) etc.

The student can create multiple rooms to tailor to multiple applications, and control whether each room is public, unpublished (not visible to anyone), or visible by request. If visible by request, then the recruiter who visits the custom room link sees the request button, the student receives an email notification containing the requester's name and company, and they can grant access with an optional time limit.

To upload materials to each room, students go into their profile to upload documents to different sections (ex. reference letters). In each room's settings, there's a hierarchical dropdown of all files the student uploaded to their profile. They can check a box to add that file into the specific room. Students can re-organize the order that their selected items are displayed in the room. Each item can be set as read-only or downloadable. If someone tries to print the room page, the action is logged and IMI is notified.

In the room, companies can leave comments about each item and send interview requests easily, which shows up as an email in the student's inbox.

For each virtual room edit panel, there's a button to preview the page from the published perspective.

# Future Expansions

- **Watermarking**: For read-only documents, dynamically watermark PDFs with the viewer's name/company and timestamp
- **Session tracking**: Beyond print attempts, log time spent on each document, download attempts, and viewing patterns
- **Expiring links**: Not just time-limited access, but also view-count limited (e.g., "expires after 10 views or 7 days")

- **Industry-specific templates**: Pre-configured room structures for different industries (tech, finance, healthcare)
- **Quick clone**: Let students duplicate and modify existing successful room configurations

- **Embedded video introductions**: Allow students to add short Loom-style video explanations for complex projects
- **Interactive portfolios**: For design/coding students, embed live demos or interactive prototypes
- **Asynchronous Q&A**: Beyond comments, add a structured Q&A section where recruiters can ask questions and students can respond
- **Recruiter bookmarking**: Let companies bookmark specific items for internal discussion

- **Activity digest emails**: Weekly summaries of who viewed what, rather than individual notifications
- **Anonymous viewing option**: Let students enable anonymous initial viewing with reveal-on-interest

- **Company connection**: When students have worked with a company through IMI co-ops, highlight this relationship in the room
- **Network leverage**: Show mutual connections between the student and viewing company
- **Achievement badges**: Display IMI certifications and milestone achievements prominently

- **Engagement heatmap**: Visual representation of which documents get the most attention

- **AI-powered suggestions**: Based on job descriptions, suggest which documents to include
