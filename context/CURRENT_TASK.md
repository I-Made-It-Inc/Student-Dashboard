I just added a login page that allows user to either sign in as developers (static data), or with their Microsoft account (sync profile with Dataverse Contacts). I also stored Blueprint submissions in Azure SQL Database.

TODOs:
- For new MS accounts, remove job title & phone placeholder text

- XP system backend
- idea submission backend
- Connection request
- course catalogue
