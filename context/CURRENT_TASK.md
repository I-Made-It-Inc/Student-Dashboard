I just added a login page that allows user to either sign in as developers (static data), or with their Microsoft account (sync profile with Dataverse Contacts). I also stored Blueprint submissions in Azure SQL Database.

TODOs:
- XP system backend
  - On blueprint submission success, update blueprint page available XP & lifetime XP
  - MS mode season points (both dashboard & blueprint pages)

- idea submission backend
- Connection request
- course catalogue
